This allows you to manage your additional dependencies, and release versions of your project, using standard npm practices. The initial version is 0.0.1 but should be edited according to your project release requirements.
The list of dependencies for this project are in the file "packages.json"

For Arduino use the sketch in the directory  "RPI_ADC_Hat_analognwifi_rev1"
In the root directory the file "esp32c3setup arduino" show the setting under Tools in the arduino IDE (1.8.16)
